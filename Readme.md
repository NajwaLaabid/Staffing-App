# Staffing App

## Project Desription 

Staffing App is a simple project management app meant for relatively small scale projects. The app supports the following services/features:

* Creation of project timeline
* Tracking of resource allocation per project (resource being the employees assigned to the project, hence the name "Staffing App")
* Tracking of project assignment per employee
* Analysis of project development over time and comparison between actual and expected performance
* Managerial dashboard to manage assignment and monitor the workflow

The app was initially developed for [JESA Morocco](http://www.ocpgroup.ma/excellence-mondiale/partenariats-cles/jacobs-engineering-sa-jesa) to be used by their electrical engineering department (ICS).
